# Slot_machine

- A simple project that mimics a slot machine with ```A```, ```B```, ```C```, ```D``` representing the slot symbols.
- You can win only if you get a row of three similar letters.
- Each letter has a different value which is multiplied by the bet amount.

## Bugs :bug:
- None.

## Future development
The project is a simple one and the following developments are to be made:
- Replacing symbols with designed symbols just like in real-life slot machines.
- Increasing the number of rows after bet to 7.
- Create a UI where the user can register, login and play.
- Connecting the app to a database after completing the developments above.
